# Stoic Quotes

This is a small application that displays a random Stoic quote each time the user clicks the "Next" button. The quotes are retrieved from a JSON file and displayed on the screen using JavaScript. The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Installation

To use this application, you can simply download the source code and open the index.html file in your web browser. The application requires an internet connection to fetch the quotes from the JSON file.

## Usage

Once you have opened the application in your web browser, you can click the "Next" button to display a new Stoic quote. The quote will be displayed in a bordered box, and the date will be displayed above it. The button has a hover effect that pops the button, and the text displayed doesn't move the button.

## Credits

The quotes used in this application are from the Stoic Quotes API, which provides a free API for retrieving Stoic quotes.

The application uses the following libraries and frameworks:

    Tailwind CSS for styling
    jQuery for DOM manipulation
    Axios for making HTTP requests
